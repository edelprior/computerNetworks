Following the tutorial on Lynda (https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Node-js-Real-Time-Web-Socket-IO/633868-2.html)
I was able to achieve a chat application through the Client/Server simulation using Socket.IO, and Express.



###
In this code, a server is created using Express.js , a web server framework and Socket.IO, a web library that controls events. With the help of Babel.js, everything compiles to make the application readable through all servers and browsers.
